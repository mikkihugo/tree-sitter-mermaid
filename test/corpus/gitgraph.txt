Simple git graph
==========================

gitGraph
    commit id:"a"
    commit id:"b"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id:"c"
    checkout main
    merge develop

(source_file
  (diagram_gitgraph
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_branch
      (gitgraph_branch_name))
    (gitgraph_stmt_checkout
      (gitgraph_branch_name))
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_checkout
      (gitgraph_branch_name))
    (gitgraph_stmt_merge
      (gitgraph_branch_name))))

==========================
Git graph with custom IDs and tags
==========================

gitGraph
    commit id:"first"
    commit id:"second" tag:"v1.0"
    branch feature
    commit id:"feature-work"
    checkout main
    merge feature

---

(source_file
  (diagram_gitgraph
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_branch
      (gitgraph_branch_name))
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_checkout
      (gitgraph_branch_name))
    (gitgraph_stmt_merge
      (gitgraph_branch_name))))

==========================
Git graph with commit types
==========================

gitGraph
    commit id:"normal-commit"
    commit id:"highlight" type:HIGHLIGHT
    commit id:"reverse" type:REVERSE
    branch release
    checkout release
    commit id:"release-prep"
    checkout main
    merge release

(source_file
  (diagram_gitgraph
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_branch
      (gitgraph_branch_name))
    (gitgraph_stmt_checkout
      (gitgraph_branch_name))
    (gitgraph_stmt_commit)
    (gitgraph_stmt_checkout
      (gitgraph_branch_name))
    (gitgraph_stmt_merge
      (gitgraph_branch_name))))
